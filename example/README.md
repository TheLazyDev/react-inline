# React Inline Example Project

This example utilizes React Inline's CLI to do the dirty work. See the Makefile for details.

To run it in development environment, execute

```bash
$ make run
```

To run it in production environment (which compresses and minifies CSS and class names), execute

```bash
$ make run-production
```

After that, point your web browser to `http://localhost:3000`.

Use your browser's "Inspect Element" tool to see how all styles were turned into class names.

After transformation, all files generated by React Inline will be in the `lib/` directory.
