## Contributing

1. Fork it ( https://github.com/martinandert/react-inline )
2. Run `bin/setup` to install dependencies.
3. Run the tests. We only take pull requests with passing tests, and it's great to know that you have a clean slate: `bin/rake test`.
4. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
5. Add a test for your change. Only refactoring and documentation changes require no new tests. If you are adding functionality or are fixing a bug, we need a test!
6. Make the test pass.
7. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'add some feature'`)
8. Push to your fork (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
9. Create a new Pull Request
